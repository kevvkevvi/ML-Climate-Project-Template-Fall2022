## Kevin Li's Journal For Machine Learning & Climate

* 9/14/22: First commit; Forking the final project github repo
    * I completed the forking process and filled out my survey

* 9/19/22: Found a dataset pertaining to CO2 emission of cars and a dataset about the circularity of lithium-ion battery materials in electric vehicles
    * This may become part of my plan for the final project

* 10/5/22: Start data exploration
    * I started exploring the data and plotting some graphs

* 10/10/22: Start data cleaning
    * I started cleaning the data and making it more usable

* 10/15/22: Give up on the topic
    * I gave up on the topic because I couldn't understand the chemical features behind the data, and I couldn't find any other datasets that would be useful for my project. This reduced my motivation to work on the topic.

* 10/18/22: Found a dataset about CPU and GPU performance
    * I found a dataset about CPU and GPU performance, and I think it would be a good topic for my final project since I have some experience with computer hardware and have a passion for microprocessors.

* 10/20/22: Start data exploration
    * I started exploring the data and plotting some graphs

* 10/25/22: Start data preprocessing
    * I started cleaning the data and making it more usable
    * Performed some feature encoding and feature scaling

* 10/30/22: Start planning for the final project
    * I started planning for the final project and started to think about what I want to do

* 11/5/22: Case study
    * I started working on a case study about predicting the type of microprocessor

* 11/6/22: Case study
    * I started planning case studies about predicting the power consumption and performance of microprocessors

* 11/10/22: Create models
    * I created several models for predicting the type of microprocessor and finished the case study

* 11/15/22: Create models
    * I created several models for predicting the power consumption and performance of microprocessors

* 11/29/22: Performance analysis
    * I started analyzing the performance of the models for my first case study about predicting the type of microprocessor

* 12/7/22: Performance analysis
    * I started analyzing the performance of the models for my case studies about predicting the power consumption and performance of microprocessors

* 12/8/22: Write technical paper
    * I started writing the technical paper for my final project

* 12/15/22: Finish technical paper
    * I finished writing the technical paper for my final project and committing all the work to the final project github repo
