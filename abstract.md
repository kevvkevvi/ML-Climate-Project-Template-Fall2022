Microchips, such as CPUs and GPUs, are an essential component of modern computing systems. Their performance and efficiency can have a significant impact on the overall performance and energy consumption of a system. Accurate predictions of microchip features can help researchers, developers, and engineers design more efficient and sustainable technology. In this paper, we aim to predict the performance and power consumption features of microchips using Machine Learning techniques and evaluate the performance of different algorithms for this task. Our results show that there are models that can make accurate predictions of microchip type, power consumption, and performance. We use a dataset from Kaggle that consists of 4853 samples and 14 features that relate to CPU and GPU power consumption, performance, and other details. We focus on predicting the chip type, chip power consumption, GPU chip performance, and CPU chip performance. For each of these case studies, we used 6-8 different classification and regression algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and many more. Our results show that for each case study, there are models that can make predictions with high accuracy and precision on the microchips' type, power consumption, and performance. We evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification, and mean absolute error and $R^2$ score for regression. We compared the performance of the different algorithms in each case study and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
